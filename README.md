**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-01-silo-finance/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).



_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

- Donation/first deposit attack is possible but unprofitable because of decimal offset.
- Any issue reported in previous audits.

# Overview

Silo Finance is a non-custodial money protocol that implements permissionless, isolated lending markets, known as silos. Silo Vault serves as the managed liquidity layer, channeling liquidity into Silo’s lending markets (silos) or any 4626 lending markets.

# Additional context

## Main invariants

See [Certora prover specs files](https://github.com/silo-finance/silo-contracts-v2/tree/develop/certora/specs/vaults)


## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
Forked code: SiloVault is a fork of MorphoVault. Original code only supported deploying capital to Morpho protocol while SiloVault was changed to support any ERC4626 vault and highly configurable rewards. Admin role stayed unchanged. New admin function were added to manage rewards setup. It is a good start to make sure that code integrity is kept and no bugs were introduced during forking.

Rewards: SiloVault supports custom rewards distribution. It is important that rewards do not compromise the SiloVault logic in any way and are distributed correctly.

## All trusted roles in the protocol


✅ 

| Role                                | Description                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Owner                             |                               |
| Guardian                          |                               |
| Allocator                         |                               |

Same as MorphoVault with addition to new privileges for owner to manage the rewards. For details, see Morpho docs.

See docs: https://github.com/silo-finance/silo-contracts-v2/blob/develop/MOREDOCS.md 


```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-03-silo-finance.git
cd 2025-03-silo-finance

# Create the file ".env" in a root of this folder. ".env.example" is an example.
# RPC_MAINNET, RPC_ARBITRUM, RPC_ANVIL, PRIVATE_KEY are required to run the tests.

#  Build Silo foundry utils to prepare tools for Silo deployment and testing
